# Scrape Stackover Jobs with Scrapy

I found this girl/woman after I started using/learning Scrapy. I wish I had her site as a startup guide at the jump. [scrape-stack-overflow-jobs](http://kimberlythegeek.com/scrape-stack-overflow-jobs/)

### Linux Terminal History:

go to my desired directory

> cd '/home/mezcel/github/googlemaps-api-helloworld/scrapy_virtualenv_helloworld'

activate my virtual environment

> source bin/activate

create my new crawler

> scrapy startproject stackoverflow
