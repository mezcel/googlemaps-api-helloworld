## My traveling free-wifi stop map: Used for proximity and landmark orienteering... on the road

### Current Dev Stop Point

* The JS is a bit sloppy, not optimized, but it works fine and makes sense.
* I will tidy up the style related library some other time.
* I would love to know how to "group cluster" using street name address. Google API seems to only like LatLong for that feature. I looked into "Reverse Geocode", but that is not doing the trick at the moment either.

### Proprietary Scripts

* [googlemaps-geometry.js](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [bootstrap-select](https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/)
* [jquery-csv.js](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv/)

### Tools/Reffs Used for Continued Development

* [I need this for lat/lon](http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)
* [Googlemaps api clustering](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering)
* [Googlemaps api directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-panel)
