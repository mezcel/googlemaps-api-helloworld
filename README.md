## My traveling free-wifi map: Used for proximity and landmark orienteering

### Current Dev Stop Point

* Still figuring out how it should look, that explains all the rando-styles and libraries
* I hope to knock out a technique to filter and consolidate my waypoints
* I dont know how to "group cluster" using street name address, Google API seems to only like LatLong. Reverse Geocode is not doing the trick at the moment either

### Proprietary Scripts

* [googlemaps api](https://github.com/googlemaps/)
* [googlemaps-geometry.js](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [markerclusterer.js](https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/blob/master/markerclusterer/src/markerclusterer.js)
* [jquery-csv.js](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv/)

### My Application features were inspired by:

* [jquery-csv](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv/)

### Tools/Reffs Used for Continued Development

* [I need this for lat/lon](http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)
* [Googlemaps api clustering](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering)
* [Googlemaps api directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-panel)
